<br>

![](plot/research-process.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Types of data analysis

<br>

-   **Quantitative Methods**
    -   Testing theories using numbers
-   **Qualitative Methods**
    -   Testing theories using language
        -   Magazine articles/Interviews
        -   Conversations
        -   Newspapers
        -   Media broadcasts

## Initial observation

-   Find something that needs explaining

    -   Observe the real world
    -   Read other research

-   Test the concept: collect data

    -   Collect data to see whether your hunch is correct
    -   To do this you need to define variables
        -   Anything that can be measured and can differ across entities or time.

<br>

![](plot/research-process-1.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Generating and testing theories

-   

    -   **Theory**
        -   A hypothesized general principle or set of principles that explains known findings about a topic and from which new hypotheses can be generated.
    -   **Hypothesis**
        -   A prediction from a theory.
        -   e.g. the number of people turning up for a Big Brother audition that have narcissistic personality disorder will be higher than the general level (1%) in the population.
    -   **Falsification**
        -   The act of disproving a theory or hypothesis.

## Generating and testing theories

-   A table of the number of people at the Big Brother audition split by whether they had narcissistic personality disorder and whether they were selected as contestants by the producers.

|     -   There are only two categories                                                   |     -   Equal intervals on the variable represent equal differences in the property being measured                          |
|     -   e.g. dead or alive.                                                             |     -   e.g. the difference between 6 and 8 is equivalent to the difference between 13 and 15.                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -   **Nominal variable**                                                                | -   **Ratio variable**                                                                                                      |

|     -   There are more than two categories                                              |     -   e.g. a score of 16 on an anxiety scale means that the person is, in reality, twice as anxious as someone scoring 8. |
|                                                                                         |                                                                                                                             |
|     -   e.g. whether someone is an omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, or fruitarian.          |                                                                                                                             |

|     -   e.g. whether people got a fail, a pass, a merit or a distinction in their exam. |                                                                                                                             |

## Which level of measurement involves categories with no inherent order? {.quiz-question}

- [Nominal]{.correct data-explanation="Nominal variables classify data into distinct categories without any logical order. For example, dietary preferences like omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, or fruitarian are nominal."}
- Interval
- Ratio
- Ordinal



## Which level of measurement allows for meaningful ratios and has a true zero point? {.quiz-question}

- Nominal
- [Ratio]{.correct data-explanation="Ratio variables have all the properties of interval variables, but also include a true zero point, allowing for meaningful comparisons like 'twice as much'. For example, a score of 16 on an anxiety scale means twice the anxiety of a score of 8."}
- Interval
- Ordinal



## Which type of variable has only two categories, such as 'dead' or 'alive'? {.quiz-question}

- Interval
- [Binary]{.correct data-explanation="Binary variables are categorical variables with only two possible values, such as 'yes' or 'no', 'dead' or 'alive'."}
- Nominal
- Ordinal



## Which level of measurement includes categories that have a logical order but no consistent interval between them? {.quiz-question}

- Interval
- Nominal
- Ratio
- [Ordinal]{.correct data-explanation="Ordinal variables have categories with a meaningful order, such as exam results: fail, pass, merit, distinction. However, the intervals between categories are not necessarily equal."}



## Measurement error

-   

    -   The discrepancy between the actual value we’re trying to measure, and the number we use to represent that value.
    -   Example:
        -   You (in reality) weigh 80 kg.
        -   You stand on your bathroom scales and they say 83 kg.
        -   The measurement error is 3 kg.

## Validity

<br>

-   

    -   Whether an instrument measures what it set out to measure.

    -   **Content validity**

        -   Evidence that the content of a test corresponds to the content of the construct it was designed to cover

    -   **Ecological validity**

        -   Evidence that the results of a study, experiment or test can be applied, and allow inferences, to real-world conditions.

## Reliability

<br>

-   

    -   **Reliability**
        -   The ability of the measure to produce the same results under the same conditions.
    -   **Test–Retest Reliability**
        -   The ability of a measure to produce consistent results when the same entities are tested at two different points in time.
        


## Which type of validity assesses whether a measurement tool covers all relevant aspects of the concept being studied? {.quiz-question}

- Construct validity
- [Content validity]{.correct data-explanation="Content validity ensures that a measurement instrument includes all necessary components of the concept it aims to measure. For example, a survey on empowerment should include questions on decision-making, mobility, and access to resources—not just income."}
- External validity
- Ecological validity



## Which type of validity is concerned with whether study results can be generalized to real-world settings? {.quiz-question}

- Content validity
- Face validity
- Internal validity
- [Ecological validity]{.correct data-explanation="Ecological validity refers to the extent to which the findings of a study can be applied to real-life situations. For example, results from an urban SMS trial may not generalize to rural areas with limited phone access."}



## A survey on farmer empowerment includes only questions about income and land ownership. What type of validity is most likely lacking? {.quiz-question}

- Statistical conclusion validity
- Ecological validity
- [Content validity]{.correct data-explanation="This survey lacks content validity because it does not capture all dimensions of empowerment, such as decision-making, mobility, and access to extension services."}
- Face validity



## Data collection 2: How to measure

-   

    -   **Correlational research**
        -   Observing what naturally goes on in the world without directly interfering with it.
    -   **Cross-sectional research**
        -   This term implies that data come from people at different age points, with different people representing each age point.
    -   **Experimental research**
        -   One or more variable is systematically manipulated to see their effect (alone or in combination) on an outcome variable.
        -   Statements can be made about cause and effect.

## The research process

<br>

## Fitting model to real-world data

<br>

![](plot/figure-1.png){fig-align="center" width="70%" height="70%"}

## Population and samples

-   

    -   **Population**

        -   The collection of units (be they people, plankton, plants, cities, suicidal authors, etc.) to which we want to generalize a set of findings or a statistical model

    -   **Sample**

        -   A smaller (but hopefully representative) collection of units from a population used to determine truths about that population

## A simple statistical model

<br>

$$
outcome_i = (model) + error_i
$$ <br>

-   

    -   In statistics we fit models to our data (i.e. we use a statistical model to represent what is happening in the real world).
    -   The mean is a hypothetical value (i.e. it doesn’t have to be a value that actually exists in the data set).
    -   As such, the mean is simple statistical model.

## The Mean

<br>

$$
\text{mean} (\bar{X}) = \frac{\Sigma^n_{i=1} x_i}{n}
$$

<br>

-   

    -   The mean is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores.
    -   The mean is also the value from which the (squared) scores deviate least (it has the least error).

## The Mean: example

<br>

-   Collect some data

$$
1, 3, 4, 3, 2
$$

-   Add them up

$$ 
\Sigma^n_{i=1}x_i = 1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 13 
$$

-   Divide by the number of scores, $n$:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\Sigma^n_{i=1}x_i}{n} = \frac{13}{5} = 2.6
$$

## The Mean as a model

<br>

$$
outcome_i = (model) + error_i
$$

$$
outcome_{lecture1} = (\bar{x}) + error_{lecture1}
$$

$$
1 = 2.6 + error_{lecture1}
$$

## Measuring the 'fit' of a model

<br>

-   

    -   The mean is a model of what happens in the real world: the typical score.

    -   It is not a perfect representation of the data.

    -   How can we assess how well the mean represents reality?

## A Perfect Fit

<br>

![](plot/perfect_fit.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="70%" height="70%"}

## Calculating error

-   

    -   A deviation is the difference between the mean and an actual data point.
    -   Deviations can be calculated by taking each score and subtracting the mean from it:

$$
\text{deviation} = x_i - \bar{x}
$$

## Calculating error

![](plot/n_friends.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="65%" heigh="65%"}

## Use the total error?

<br>

-   

    -   We could just take the error between the mean and the data and add them.

$$
\Sigma(x_i - \bar{x} = 0)
$$

![](plot/table-2.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Sum of squared errors

<br>

-   

    -   We could add the deviations to find out the total error.
    -   Deviations cancel out because some are positive and others negative.
    -   Therefore, we square each deviation.
    -   If we add these squared deviations we get the sum of squared errors (SS).

## Sum of squared errors

<br>

$$
SS = \Sigma(x_i - \bar{x})^2 = 5.20
$$

![](plot/table-3.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Variance

<br>

-   

    -   The sum of squares is a good measure of overall variability, but is dependent on the number of scores.
    -   We calculate the average variability by dividing by the number of scores ($n$).
    -   This value is called the variance ($s^2$).

$$
\text{variance} (s^2) = \frac{SS}{N-1} = \frac{\Sigma(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N-1} = 1.3
$$

## Degrees of freedom

<br>

![](plot/figure-2.png){fig-align="center" width="70%" height="70%"}

## Standard deviation

<br>

-   

    -   The variance has one problem: it is measured in units squared.
    -   This isn’t a very meaningful metric so we take the square root value.
    -   This is the standard deviation (s).

$$
s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N-1}} = \sqrt{\frac{5.20}{5}} = 1.02
$$

## Important things to remember

<br>

-   

    -   The sum of squares, variance, and standard deviation represent the same thing:
        -   The ‘fit’ of the mean to the data
        -   The variability in the data
        -   How well the mean represents the observed data
        -   Error

## Same mean, different SD

<br>

![](plot/figure-3.png){fig-align="center" width="90%" height="90%"}

## SD and shape of distribution

<br>

![](plot/figure-4.png){fig-align="center" width="90%" height="90%"}

## Sample vs Population

<br>

-   

    -   **Sample**
        -   Mean and SD describe only the sample from which they were calculated.
    -   **Population**
        -   Mean and SD are intended to describe the entire population (very rare in psychology).
    -   **Sample to Population**
        -   Mean and SD are obtained from a sample, but are used to estimate the mean and SD of the population (very common in psychology).

## Sample vs Population

<br>

![](plot/figure-5.png){fig-align="center" width="90%" height="90%"}

## Confidence interval (CI)

<br>

-   

    -   Domjan et al. (1998)
        -   ‘Conditioned’ sperm release in Japanese quail.
    -   True mean
        -   15 million sperm
    -   Sample mean
        -   17 million sperm
    -   Interval estimate
        -   12 to 22 million (contains true value)
        -   16 to 18 million (misses true value)
        -   CIs constructed such that 95% contain the true value.

## Confidence interval (CI)

## Confidence interval (CI)

<br>

![](plot/figure-7.png){fig-align="center" width="50%" height="50%"}

## Test statistics

<br>

-   

    -   A statistic for which the frequency of particular values is known.
    -   Observed values can be used to test hypotheses.

$$
test\ statistic = \frac{variance\ explained\ by\ the\ model} {variance\ not\ explained\ by\ the\ model} = \frac{effect}{error}
$$
