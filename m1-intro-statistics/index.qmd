## The research process

<br>

![](plot/research-process.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Types of data analysis

<br>

-   **Quantitative Methods**
    -   Testing theories using numbers
-   **Qualitative Methods**
    -   Testing theories using language
        -   Magazine articles/Interviews
        -   Conversations
        -   Newspapers
        -   Media broadcasts

## Initial observation

-   Find something that needs explaining

    -   Observe the real world
    -   Read other research

-   Test the concept: collect data

    -   Collect data to see whether your hunch is correct
    -   To do this you need to define variables
        -   Anything that can be measured and can differ across entities or time.

## The research process

<br>

![](plot/research-process-1.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Generating and testing theories

-   

    -   **Theory**
        -   A hypothesized general principle or set of principles that explains known findings about a topic and from which new hypotheses can be generated.
    -   **Hypothesis**
        -   A prediction from a theory.
        -   e.g. the number of people turning up for a Big Brother audition that have narcissistic personality disorder will be higher than the general level (1%) in the population.
    -   **Falsification**
        -   The act of disproving a theory or hypothesis.

## Generating and testing theories

-   A table of the number of people at the Big Brother audition split by whether they had narcissistic personality disorder and whether they were selected as contestants by the producers.

|     -   There are only two categories                                                   |     -   Equal intervals on the variable represent equal differences in the property being measured                          |
|     -   e.g. dead or alive.                                                             |     -   e.g. the difference between 6 and 8 is equivalent to the difference between 13 and 15.                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -   **Nominal variable**                                                                | -   **Ratio variable**                                                                                                      |

|     -   There are more than two categories                                              |     -   e.g. a score of 16 on an anxiety scale means that the person is, in reality, twice as anxious as someone scoring 8. |
|                                                                                         |                                                                                                                             |
|     -   e.g. whether someone is an omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, or fruitarian.          |                                                                                                                             |

## Which level of measurement involves categories with no inherent order? {.quiz-question}

-   [Nominal]{.correct data-explanation="Nominal variables classify data into distinct categories without any logical order. For example, dietary preferences like omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, or fruitarian are nominal."}
-   Interval
-   Ratio
-   Ordinal

## Which level of measurement allows for meaningful ratios and has a true zero point? {.quiz-question}

-   Nominal
-   [Ratio]{.correct data-explanation="Ratio variables have all the properties of interval variables, but also include a true zero point, allowing for meaningful comparisons like 'twice as much'. For example, a score of 16 on an anxiety scale means twice the anxiety of a score of 8."}
-   Interval
-   Ordinal

## Which type of variable has only two categories, such as 'dead' or 'alive'? {.quiz-question}

-   Interval
-   [Binary]{.correct data-explanation="Binary variables are categorical variables with only two possible values, such as 'yes' or 'no', 'dead' or 'alive'."}
-   Nominal
-   Ordinal

## Which level of measurement includes categories that have a logical order but no consistent interval between them? {.quiz-question}

-   Interval
-   Nominal
-   Ratio
-   [Ordinal]{.correct data-explanation="Ordinal variables have categories with a meaningful order, such as exam results: fail, pass, merit, distinction. However, the intervals between categories are not necessarily equal."}

## Measurement error

-   

    -   The discrepancy between the actual value we’re trying to measure, and the number we use to represent that value.
    -   Example:
        -   You (in reality) weigh 80 kg.
        -   You stand on your bathroom scales and they say 83 kg.
        -   The measurement error is 3 kg.

## Validity

<br>

-   

    -   Whether an instrument measures what it set out to measure.

    -   **Content validity**

        -   Evidence that the content of a test corresponds to the content of the construct it was designed to cover

    -   **Ecological validity**

        -   Evidence that the results of a study, experiment or test can be applied, and allow inferences, to real-world conditions.

## Reliability

<br>

-   

    -   **Reliability**
        -   The ability of the measure to produce the same results under the same conditions.
    -   **Test–Retest Reliability**
        -   The ability of a measure to produce consistent results when the same entities are tested at two different points in time.

## Which type of validity assesses whether a measurement tool covers all relevant aspects of the concept being studied? {.quiz-question}

-   Construct validity
-   [Content validity]{.correct data-explanation="Content validity ensures that a measurement instrument includes all necessary components of the concept it aims to measure. For example, a survey on empowerment should include questions on decision-making, mobility, and access to resources—not just income."}
-   External validity
-   Ecological validity

## Which type of validity is concerned with whether study results can be generalized to real-world settings? {.quiz-question}

-   Content validity
-   Face validity
-   Internal validity
-   [Ecological validity]{.correct data-explanation="Ecological validity refers to the extent to which the findings of a study can be applied to real-life situations. For example, results from an urban SMS trial may not generalize to rural areas with limited phone access."}

## A survey on farmer empowerment includes only questions about income and land ownership. What type of validity is most likely lacking? {.quiz-question}

-   Statistical conclusion validity
-   Ecological validity
-   [Content validity]{.correct data-explanation="This survey lacks content validity because it does not capture all dimensions of empowerment, such as decision-making, mobility, and access to extension services."}
-   Face validity

## Data collection 2: How to measure

-   

    -   **Correlational research**
        -   Observing what naturally goes on in the world without directly interfering with it.
    -   **Cross-sectional research**
        -   This term implies that data come from people at different age points, with different people representing each age point.
    -   **Experimental research**
        -   One or more variable is systematically manipulated to see their effect (alone or in combination) on an outcome variable.
        -   Statements can be made about cause and effect.

## The research process

<br>

![](plot/research-process-3.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Fitting model to real-world data

<br>

![](plot/figure-1.png){fig-align="center" width="70%" height="70%"}

## Population and samples

-   

    -   **Population**

        -   The collection of units (be they people, plankton, plants, cities, suicidal authors, etc.) to which we want to generalize a set of findings or a statistical model

    -   **Sample**

        -   A smaller (but hopefully representative) collection of units from a population used to determine truths about that population

## A simple statistical model

<br>

$$
outcome_i = (model) + error_i
$$ <br>

-   

    -   In statistics we fit models to our data (i.e. we use a statistical model to represent what is happening in the real world).
    -   The mean is a hypothetical value (i.e. it doesn’t have to be a value that actually exists in the data set).
    -   As such, the mean is simple statistical model.

## Measuring the 'fit' of a model

<br>

-   

    -   The mean is a model of what happens in the real world: the typical score.

    -   It is not a perfect representation of the data.

    -   How can we assess how well the mean represents reality?

## A Perfect Fit

<br>

![](plot/perfect_fit.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="70%" height="70%"}

## Calculating error

-   

    -   A deviation is the difference between the mean and an actual data point.
    -   Deviations can be calculated by taking each score and subtracting the mean from it:

$$
\text{deviation} = x_i - \bar{x}
$$

## Calculating error

![](plot/n_friends.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="65%" heigh="65%"}

## Use the total error?

<br>

-   

    -   We could just take the error between the mean and the data and add them.

$$
\Sigma(x_i - \bar{x} = 0)
$$

![](plot/table-2.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Sum of squared errors

<br>

-   

    -   We could add the deviations to find out the total error.
    -   Deviations cancel out because some are positive and others negative.
    -   Therefore, we square each deviation.
    -   If we add these squared deviations we get the sum of squared errors (SS).

## Sum of squared errors

<br>

$$
SS = \Sigma(x_i - \bar{x})^2 = 5.20
$$

![](plot/table-3.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Variance

<br>

-   

    -   The sum of squares is a good measure of overall variability, but is dependent on the number of scores.
    -   We calculate the average variability by dividing by the number of scores ($n$).
    -   This value is called the variance ($s^2$).

$$
\text{variance} (s^2) = \frac{SS}{N-1} = \frac{\Sigma(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N-1} = 1.3
$$

## Important things to remember

<br>

-   

    -   The sum of squares, variance, and standard deviation represent the same thing:
        -   The ‘fit’ of the mean to the data
        -   The variability in the data
        -   How well the mean represents the observed data
        -   Error

## Same mean, different SD

## Sample vs Population

<br>

-   

    -   **Sample**
        -   Mean and SD describe only the sample from which they were calculated.
    -   **Population**
        -   Mean and SD are intended to describe the entire population (very rare in psychology).
    -   **Sample to Population**
        -   Mean and SD are obtained from a sample, but are used to estimate the mean and SD of the population (very common in psychology).

## What does a “perfect fit” in a statistical model imply? {.quiz-question}

- The model has zero variance

- [All predicted values match observed values exactly]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! A perfect fit means the model’s predictions align exactly with the observed data, resulting in zero error."}

- The model uses only nominal data

- The sample size is maximized



## Which of the following is used to quantify the total error in a model? {.quiz-question}

- Mean absolute deviation

- [Sum of squared errors]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! The sum of squared errors (SSE) aggregates the squared differences between predicted and actual values to assess model fit."}

- Interquartile range

- Mode



## What does variance measure in a dataset? {.quiz-question}

- The central tendency

- The number of categories

- [The average squared deviation from the mean]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Variance captures how much the data points deviate from the mean, squared to emphasize larger differences."}

- The correlation between variables



## Two datasets have the same mean but different standard deviations. What does this indicate? {.quiz-question}

- They have identical distributions

- [One dataset is more spread out than the other]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! A higher standard deviation means the data is more dispersed around the mean."}

- Both datasets are skewed

- The sample sizes are equal



## Which shape of distribution is most likely to have a higher standard deviation? {.quiz-question}

- Symmetric and narrow

- Uniform

- [Skewed with long tails]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Skewed distributions with long tails tend to have more extreme values, increasing the standard deviation."}

- Bell-shaped with low variance
