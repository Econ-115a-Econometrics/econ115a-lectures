## The research process

<br>

![](plot/research-process.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Types of data analysis

<br>

-   **Quantitative Methods**
    -   Testing theories using numbers
-   **Qualitative Methods**
    -   Testing theories using language
        -   Magazine articles/Interviews
        -   Conversations
        -   Newspapers
        -   Media broadcasts

## Initial observation

-   Find something that needs explaining

    -   Observe the real world
    -   Read other research

-   Test the concept: collect data

    -   Collect data to see whether your hunch is correct
    -   To do this you need to define variables
        -   Anything that can be measured and can differ across entities or time.

<br>

![](plot/research-process-1.png){fig-align="center" width="60%" height="60%"}

## Generating and testing theories

-
  -   **Theory**
      -   A hypothesized general principle or set of principles that explains known findings about a topic and from which new hypotheses can be generated.
  -   **Hypothesis**
      -   A prediction from a theory.
      -   e.g. the number of people turning up for a Big Brother audition that have narcissistic personality disorder will be higher than the general level (1%) in the population.
  -   **Falsification**
      -   The act of disproving a theory or hypothesis.

## Generating and testing theories

-   A table of the number of people at the Big Brother audition split by whether they had narcissistic personality disorder and whether they were selected as contestants by the producers.

+=========================================================================================+=============================================================================================================================+
| -   **Binary variable**                                                                 | -   **Interval variable**                                                                                                   |
|     -   There are only two categories                                                   |     -   Equal intervals on the variable represent equal differences in the property being measured                          |
|     -   e.g. dead or alive.                                                             |     -   e.g. the difference between 6 and 8 is equivalent to the difference between 13 and 15.                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -   **Nominal variable**                                                                | -   **Ratio variable**                                                                                                      |

|     -   There are more than two categories                                              |     -   e.g. a score of 16 on an anxiety scale means that the person is, in reality, twice as anxious as someone scoring 8. |
|                                                                                         |                                                                                                                             |
|     -   e.g. whether someone is an omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, or fruitarian.          |                                                                                                                             |

|     -   The same as a nominal variable but the categories have a logical order          |                                                                                                                             |
|     -   e.g. whether people got a fail, a pass, a merit or a distinction in their exam. |                                                                                                                             |

## Measurement error

- 

  - The discrepancy between the actual value we’re trying to measure, and the number we use to represent that value.
  - Example:
    - You (in reality) weigh 80 kg.
    - You stand on your bathroom scales and they say 83 kg.
    - The measurement error is 3 kg.
    
    

## Validity

<br>

-

  - Whether an instrument measures what it set out to measure.

  - **Content validity**
    - Evidence that the content of a test corresponds to the content of the construct it was designed to cover

  - **Ecological validity**
    - Evidence that the results of a study, experiment or test can be applied, and allow inferences, to real-world conditions.
    
    
    
## Reliability

<br>

-

  - **Reliability**
    - The ability of the measure to produce the same results under the same conditions.

  - **Test–Retest Reliability**
    - The ability of a measure to produce consistent results when the same entities are tested at two different points in time.
    

## Data collection 2: How to measure

-

  - **Correlational research**
    - Observing what naturally goes on in the world without directly interfering with it.

  - **Cross-sectional research**
    - This term implies that data come from people at different age points, with different people representing each age point.

  - **Experimental research**
    - One or more variable is systematically manipulated to see their effect (alone or in combination) on an outcome variable.
    - Statements can be made about cause and effect.
    

## The research process

<br>

## Fitting model to real-world data

<br>

![](plot/figure-1.png){fig-align="center" width=70% height=70%}



## Population and samples

- 

  - **Population**
  
    - The collection of units (be they people, plankton, plants, cities, suicidal authors, etc.) to which we want to generalize a set of findings or a statistical model

  - **Sample**
  
    - A smaller (but hopefully representative) collection of units from a population used to determine truths about that population



## A simple statistical model

<br>

$$
outcome_i = (model) + error_i
$$
<br>

-

  - In statistics we fit models to our data (i.e. we use a statistical model to represent what is happening in the real world).
  - The mean is a hypothetical value (i.e. it doesn’t have to be a value that actually exists in the data set).
  - As such, the mean is simple statistical model.



## The Mean

<br>

$$
\text{mean} (\bar{X}) = \frac{\Sigma^n_{i=1} x_i}{n}
$$

<br>

- 

  - The mean is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores.
  - The mean is also the value from which the (squared) scores deviate least (it has the least error).
  
  
  
## The Mean: example

<br>

  - Collect some data

$$
1, 3, 4, 3, 2
$$
    
  - Add them up
  
$$ 
\Sigma^n_{i=1}x_i = 1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 13 
$$

  - Divide by the number of scores, $n$:
  
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\Sigma^n_{i=1}x_i}{n} = \frac{13}{5} = 2.6
$$



## The Mean as a model

<br>

$$
outcome_i = (model) + error_i
$$


$$
outcome_{lecture1} = (\bar{x}) + error_{lecture1}
$$

$$
1 = 2.6 + error_{lecture1}
$$



## Measuring the 'fit' of a model

<br>

- 

  - The mean is a model of what happens in the real world: the typical score.
  
  - It is not a perfect representation of the data.
  
  - How can we assess how well the mean represents reality?



## A Perfect Fit

<br>

![](plot/perfect_fit.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="70%" height="70%"}



## Calculating error

-

  - A deviation is the difference between the mean and an actual data point.
  - Deviations can be calculated by taking each score and subtracting the mean from it:
  
$$
\text{deviation} = x_i - \bar{x}
$$

## Calculating error

![](plot/n_friends.jpeg){fig-align="center" width=65% heigh=65%}



## Use the total error?

<br>

- 

  - We could just take the error between the mean and the data and add them.
  
$$
\Sigma(x_i - \bar{x} = 0)
$$
