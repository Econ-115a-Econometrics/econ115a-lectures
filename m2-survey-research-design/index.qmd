| Sampling design       | Advantages                                                  | Disadvantages                                                |
+=======================+:============================================================+==============================================================+
| 1.  Simple random     | -   Requires little advance knowledge of population         | -   May not capture specific groups                          |
|                       |                                                             | -   May not be efficient                                     |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2.  Systematic random | -   High precision                                          | -   Ordering of elements in sampling frame may create bias.  |
|                       | -   Easy to analyze data and compute sampling errors        | -   May not capture specific groups                          |
|                       |                                                             | -   May not be efficient                                     |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3.  Stratified random | -   captures specific groups                                | -   requires advance knowledge of population                 |
|                       | -   disproportionate sampling possible                      | -   more complex to analyze data and compute sampling errors |
|                       | -   highest precision                                       |                                                              |
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4.  Cluster           | -   lower field costs                                       | -   more complex to analyze data and compute sampling errors |
|                       | -   enables sampling of groups if individuals not available | -   lowest precision                                         |

## What is the primary goal of a sampling design in survey research? {.quiz-question}

-   To reduce the number of questions

-   [To ensure the sample is representative of the population]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! A well-designed sampling plan ensures that the sample accurately reflects the population, allowing for valid generalizations."}

-   To eliminate the need for data analysis

-   To increase the response rate

## Which of the following is a probability sampling method? {.quiz-question}

-   Convenience sampling

-   Purposive sampling

-   [Simple random sampling]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Simple random sampling gives every member of the population an equal chance of being selected, making it a probability method."}

-   Snowball sampling

## What type of sampling is most prone to selection bias? {.quiz-question}

-   Stratified sampling

-   Cluster sampling

-   Systematic sampling

-   [Convenience sampling]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Convenience sampling selects participants based on ease of access, which often leads to biased, non-representative samples."}

## In stratified sampling, the population is divided into: {.quiz-question}

-   Random clusters

-   Equal-sized groups

-   [Homogeneous subgroups]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Stratified sampling divides the population into subgroups (strata) that share similar characteristics, then samples from each."}

-   Geographic zones

## Which sampling method is best when the population is widely dispersed geographically? {.quiz-question}

-   Simple random sampling

-   [Cluster sampling]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Cluster sampling is efficient for geographically spread populations by sampling entire groups or clusters."}

-   Purposive sampling

-   Quota sampling

## Sampling design

# Measurement issues in survey research

## Measurement

- 
    -   Research begins with a problem or topic, thinking about the problems results in identifying concepts that capture the phenomenon being examined.

    -   Abstract concepts and attributes should be measured carefully to be of use in the empirical level.

    -   Measurement is the process of assigning numbers to represent quantities of attributes.

    -   Rules for assigning numbers need to be standardized and uniformly applicable.

## Measurement

::: {.callout-note style="font-size: 2.0em;"}
## Measurement issues in research

-   Whether underlying characteristics of the concept allows ordering (ordinal level or categorizing (nominal level)?

-   Whether the features of the concepts are discrete or continuous with fine gradation?

-   Concepts can be measured by more than one indicator. How many indicators are appropriate to measure a concept?

-   Are measure valid and reliable?

## Criteria for good measurement

-   **Reliability**

    -   is the measurement able to consistently lead to same conclusion?

    -   clearly define how observations will be counted; make sure that questions are phrased for all respondents.

## Criteria for good measurement

-   **Validity**

    -   the extent to which a measure captures the concept it is intended to measure.

    -   check how your measurements corresponds to established theories or other measures in literature

    -   make sure to have appropriate number of observations that will represent the population

# Questionnaire construction

## Steps in questinnaire construction

-   Determination of questionnaire content
-   Framing the questions and accompanying instructions
-   Composing the form by deciding on the layout
-   Constructing the draft questionnaire (and making revisions if necessary)
-   Reproduction of the final questionnaire

## Questions and statements


-   Questionnaire - a collection of questions and statements
-   Statements - stated for the respondents to agree or disagree with.
  -   Likert scale (Rensis Likert) - formalized procedure of asking respondents their response to a statement such as strongly agree, agree, disagree, and strongly disagree (and the like)

  -   Likert - type scale has no neutral option in the middle

## Open-ended vs closed-ended questions

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Open-ended questions**

-   the respondents provides his/her own answer to the question
-   e.g., "What is your opinion on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic?"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Close-ended questions**

-   the respondents chooses from a list of pre-defined answers.
-   e.g., "Do you agree or disagree with the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic?"

    -   Agree, Disagree, Neutral, Can't say, etc.
:::
:::::

## Open-ended questions

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Advantages**

-   Can be used when all possible response categories are not known
-   Allow more detail, clarification, and qualification on the responses
-   Can be used when there are too many potential answer categories to list
-   Preferable for complex issues
-   Allow more opportunity for exploitation and self- expression.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Disadvantages**

-   May lead to collection of worthless/irrelevant information

-   Data are not standard from person to person

-   Low intercoder readability

-   Require superior respondent writing/speaking skills

-   Questions may be too general for respondent to understand.
:::
:::::

## Close-ended questions

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Advantages**

-   Comparability of answers

-   Easier to code

-   Item meaning is clearer

-   Answers tend to be complete and relevant

-   Greater inclination to answer sensitive questions

-   Easier to understand
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Disadvantages**\

-   Guessing or “random” answering

-   Inappropriate or irrelevant response categories

-   Too many categories

-   Undetected differences in interpretation

-   Less variation in responses

-   Higher likelihood of clerical error.

## Questionnaire formats for respondents

-   Ordering questions in a questionnaire can affect the answers given.

-   Do not randomize the order of questions.

-   Be sensitive to the effect of the ordering of the questions.

-   For self-administered questionnaires, begin with the most interesting set of questions. Requests for duller, demographic data should generally be placed at the end.

-   For interviews, do the opposite. The interviewer might gain rapport quickly by introducing briefly the study and getting demographic data afterwards.

## Questionnaire formats for respondents

-   Every questionnaire, whether self- administered or interview schedule, must contain clear instructions and introductory statements where appropriate.

-   For self-administered questionnaires, basic instructions as to how to complete the questionnaire is useful.

-   If the questionnaire is arranged into sub- sections, introduce each section with a short statement concerning its content and purpose.

## Questionnaire formats for respondents

-   For closed-ended questions, make clear instructions as to whether the respondents should choose only 1 or can select as many as he/she can.

-   When a set of answer categories are to be rank-ordered by the respondent, instructions should be clear as how to do the ranking, and how many answers are to be ranked.

# Basics of interviewing

## Basics of interviewing

### Phases of the interview process

-   Identification and Introduction of the Interviewer

-   Explanation of the Nature and Purpose of the Survey

-   Getting the Respondent to Initially Cooperate or Establishing Rapport

-   Interview Proper

-   Formal Closing of the Interview

## Basics of interviewing

### Interviewer attitudes

-   The job is important.

-   He must follow instructions.

-   Biases affect the quality of the data.

-   He is a professional.

-   He is a guest in someone’s home and thus treat the respondent with courtesy and respect.

-   Randomness, rather than personal decisions, works in choosing the respondents.

-   The respondent is entitled to privacy and the interviewer must help to ensure that privacy.

## Basics of interviewing

### Interviewer approach

-   Neutral

-   Confident

-   Impartial

-   Casual

-   Conversational

-   Friendly

## Basics of interviewing

### Interviewer conduct: Do's

-   Study all questions before you can ask them instead of reading them verbatim from the questionnaire.

-   Reread the instructions between interviews to pick up errors committed and correct them.

-   Check with your supervisor when you encounter difficulties.

-   Be polite as you are a guest in someone’s home.

-   Act naturally.

-   Complete the interview at one sitting.

-   Assure confidentiality.

-   Interview the person you are supposed to.

-   Interview only at the listing unit designated for the sample or follow the substitution procedures specified by the survey.

## Basics of interviewing

### Interviewer conduct: Do's

-   Use the introduction and standard replies prepared for the survey.

-   Record free-response answers verbatim.

-   Write legibly.

-   Use the response categories provided in the questionnaire.

-   Record every answer in the correct place.

-   Keep talking as you write.

-   Focus the respondent’s attention on the questions.

-   Accept a refusal graciously and naturally.

-   Check over your questionnaire before leaving the interview.

## Basics of interviewing

### Interviewer conduct: Don'ts

-   Deviate from the study, introduction and procedures provided for the survey.

-   Suggest an answer and never agree or disagree with an answer.

-   Interpret the meaning of a question, add to or subtract words from a question or change the sequence of questions.

-   Rush the respondent.

-   React to answers.

-   Record a “don’t know” answer too quickly.

-   Let another person answer for the intended respondent.

-   Let another interviewer do the work for you.
